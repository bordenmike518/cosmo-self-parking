# cosmo-self-parking

Cosmo the lovable robot never learned how to park itself when it needs to charge. Well I aim to change that.

This is an attempt to solve the issue that came with purchasing the amazing little AI bot called Cosmo. 
Originally when I purchased cosmo, I saw on it's charger that there is a pattery tag on it. I assumed this 
was for Cosmo to find it's way back to the charger so it can chage it self. Great idea, right?!?! Well, come 
to find out, this was not the case and I wasn't the only one who was upset. I started a forum on Cosmo and 
quickly rose to the number one post. So what I tried to do was train a haar cascade to recognize the battery 
logo, line it self up, then back up until it's on the charger. This is as far as I got. Maybe you can take it 
a little farther.
